# Code of Conduct

Participation in the Milou CLI project is subject to a very small set of expectations:

1. **Be respectful.** Personal attacks, discrimination, or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
2. **Assume good intent.** We are all here to improve the tooling; ask for clarification before escalating.
3. **Keep it secure.** Do not share private Milou customer information, license keys, or GHCR artifacts in public issues or PRs.
4. **Move discussions to private channels when needed.** If a topic veers into closed-source territory, stop and route it to the Milou team privately.

Report violations privately to the Milou engineering team. They reserve the right to remove content or contributors that do not follow these simple rules.
