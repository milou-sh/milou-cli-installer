# Support Guidelines

The Milou CLI installer is open source. Milou platform services and GHCR images remain commercial.

## Self-Service Resources
- Documentation: https://docs.milou.sh
- README usage guide in this repository
- `milou help` for command reference

## Community Support
Open GitHub issues for:
- Bugs in the installer or CLI scripts
- Documentation gaps
- Feature requests that do not require proprietary assets

## Commercial Support
If you have an active Milou subscription, use your private support channel or email support@milou.sh. Reference your account ID and attach relevant logs (`milou logs`, `milou status`).

## Response Expectations
We triage community issues weekly and commercial cases within the SLA defined in your contract. Please avoid filing sensitive information publicly.
